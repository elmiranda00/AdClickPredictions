# Online Ad Click Predictor

## Project Overview
This project builds a machine learning model to predict whether a consumer will click on an online ad for a food delivery company. The dataset contains **18,000 observations** of consumer click data collected during an ad campaign. The goal is to leverage consumer profiles to predict click/no-click behavior.

Additionally, a **dashboard** was developed using **R Shiny** to allow managers to explore the predictions interactively.

## Models Implemented
The following machine learning models were built and evaluated in **Python** and **R**:
- **Logistic Regression**
- **Random Forest**
- **Gradient Boosting (LightGBM/XGBoost)**

Optuna was used for hyperparameter tuning to improve model performance.
